There is a lot of missing code here, especially with the visual side of things (color mapper).

The ball.sv file should have up-to-date game logic.

There are also some cool sprites and data in this repo which you might find interesting.

The mario sprite was created by manually copying every pixel from a 16x16 image. No script needed!
